Group collaborators: Jonathan Hicks and Justin Labombard

I worked mostly independently, but I got help from Justin when it came to what the homework asked of us, as well as techniques for interpolation.

What I learned: Real-life datasets often have difficulty with sampling not being at the right time.

**NOTE** There were no graphs generated in this homework, as it's simply pre-processing. As a result, there are no captions in this homework. This assignment saves a function called Hw8.numpy that will be used in HW9.
