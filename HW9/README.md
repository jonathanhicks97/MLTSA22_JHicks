#Team members: Jonathan Hicks, Colin Horgan, Justin Labombard

#Contributions: This assignment was mostly done by Colin, with him leading Justin and me through the assignment. We all struggled a lot on this assignment, 
so having Colin's help really assisted us in doing this.

#What I learned: Adding a well trained neural network to data can help in the classification of data better than the raw data alone.
